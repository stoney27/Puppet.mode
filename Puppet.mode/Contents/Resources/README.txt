Ruby hilighting mode:

This code is based on the Ruby Mode distributed with
SubEthaEdit 2.0a.

==================== OVERVIEW ====================

This is a syntax hilighting mode for Puppet under SubEthaEdit 2.0.  It is
a work in progress, I have based it off the Ruby Mode file.  It has the basic
Resource Types, Functions and Metaparameters.  It needs work with variables
in strings and other places.

==================== QUICK START ====================

You may drop this file into one of the following directories:

+ ~/Library/Application Support/SubEthaEdit/Modes/
+ /Library/Application Support/SubEthaEdit/Modes/
+ /Network/Library/Application Support/SubEthaEdit/Modes/

As of this release, you must quit and restart SubEthaEdit to get the
mode to load.  You will see this mode as "Puppet" in the Mode menu.  If 
you want it to come up by default currently you need to remove the Pascal
mode then the .pp files will use the Puppet mode.,

==================== DISCLAIMER/LISCENSE ====================

Use this softare at your own discretion.  Neither myself (Jeff Reinecke),
nor the authors of SubEthaEdit, as well as the distributors of the
Improved Ruby Mode or SubEthaEdit can be held responsible for any damages
that this software may cause.  Of course, I seriously doubt anything will
go wrong, but I need to cover my arse, leagally speaking.  :)

This syntax coloring mode may be freely distributed and/or modified as
you wish, providing that (1) credit be given to both myself (Scott Stonefield)
and Jeff Reinecke for the intital work on the Ruby mode, and to the 
authors of SubEthaEdit for our contribustions, and (2) that
since this is a derivative work of the authors of SubEthaEdit, they still
retain copyright for the protions they wrote, and thus have the right
to stop distribution of this syntax coloring mode and any derivative work
that still contains portions of the original Ruby syntax coloring mode
that this is based upon.
